# mpi-strategy-m-codex

Audited installer and Codex skill for MPI M Strategy Chinese-English Buddhist
translation. M 1.0.2 fixes the model roles as V4 Flash source analysis,
GPT-5.6-Sol Medium drafting/accuracy/concision, two V4 Pro bilingual reviews,
and Sol High targeted fallback after review two only.

M 1.0.2 also makes cultural allusions an audited hard gate: Flash enumerates
them, authoritative web evidence is receipted before Sol starts, and Pro checks
their contextual meaning independently. `独善其身` is a release regression.

M 1.0.2 also retains the temporal/aspect, compressed-clause implicit
subjects, semantic-role separation, and per-paragraph Pro audit coverage
machine-enforced release gates.

The installer delegates all extraction, terminology, Djot, bilingual, DOCX,
subtitle, and mechanical QA work to exact locked compatibility-fork commits:

- `mpi-translations` at `e4ec4d1df9d57e2866a088878ffe671428524536`;
- `translation-toolkit` at `bc6e3310fe2df1abf23eb2bb3eda9f5b45837a2c`.

They are verified forks, not official upstream releases. Moving branches are
never followed. Every installation must pass repository verification, both
doctors, disposable fault injection, and a public live smoke before its
M-specific `READY.json` becomes ready.

M is invoked only by explicit wording such as “M方案”, “M策略”, “按M翻译”, or
`$mpi-strategy-m`. Generic translation requests are outside its trigger.
